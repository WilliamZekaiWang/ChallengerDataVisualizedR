# ChallengerDataVisualizedR
Visualizing League of Legends player data on their top players through the use of their API. Creates three functions:

informativeLPplot() shows a plot of LP to Games played alongside a linear trend line

informativeWRplot() shows a plot of WR to Games played alongside a linear trend line

interactiveplot() shows a plot of LP to Games played which you can hover across to see player name, win rate, and LP.

Graphs are generated through the use of the R package, plotly
